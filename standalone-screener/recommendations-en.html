        MEDIUM-RISK: TELEMEDICINE, CALL YOUR DOC



        Stay home and take care of yourself in home isolation. Call a medical provider within 24 hours. They will
        determine
        next steps.

        Sorry that you are feeling unwell. You have one or more symptom(s) that may be related to COVID-19. You also
        have
        medical conditions that could put you at greater risk for complications from COVID-19. Call your healthcare
        provider, clinician advice line, or telemedicine provider within 24 hours. Start home isolation. This means stay
        home except to get medical care, and do not go to work, school, or public areas. Do not use public
        transportation or
        ride sharing.

        Follow these steps to help care for yourself.

        Follow these steps to help protect others from getting sick.

        If you begin to have any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:

        Trouble breathing
        Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
        New confusion or inability to arouse
        Bluish lips or face
        *This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or
        concerning to you.

        EMERGENCY: CALL 911, GO TO ED, CALL DOCTOR



        Urgent medical attention may be needed. Please contact a doctor, go the Emergency Department, or call 9-1-1.

        Based on your reported symptoms, urgent medical attention may be needed. You should seek medical attention
        immediately.

        If you are able to go to the Emergency Department on your own: Tell the emergency staff if you have had contact
        with
        someone with similar symptoms or confirmed COVID-19. Here are some local Emergency Departments (mouse over for
        text).

        - NYU Langone at Cobble Hill ER: 83 Amity Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201

        o Undocumented/uninsured accepted

        - NY Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital ER: 506 6th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11215

        o For their hotline call: 1-646-697-9000

        Here is what to expect at the hospital (mouse over for text).

        - You might be screened even before going inside:

        o If you have respiratory symptoms, you’ll be taken to a separate area where you’ll see a doctor and your vitals
        will be taken—many hospitals have set this area up in tents so that suspected COVID-19 patients don’t have to
        enter
        the facility unless they have significant difficulty breathing or abnormal vital signs.

        - Expect to wear a mask:

        o Hospitals have begun treating every patient as a potential COVID-19 patient, therefore, most facilities will
        put
        you in a mask on arrival regardless the nature of your health emergency.

        - If you are medically stable, you may be discharged and receive instructions for caring for yourself at home.

        - If you are admitted to the emergency department, you won’t be permitted visitors.

        o Hospitals have instituted this policy to reduce the risk of infection.

        o There are some exceptions: Children may have a parent or guardian with them, as can patients with dementia or
        other communication problems.

        o Enforcement depends on the specific facility and may be on a case-by-case basis. To help mitigate the lack of
        in-person contact, many hospitals are using technological tools to allow patients to reach family and friends.

        If you call 9-1-1: Tell the operator:

        · What symptoms you are experiencing (e.g. fever, cough, shortness of breath)

        · If you have been in contact with someone with similar symptoms or confirmed COVID-19.
